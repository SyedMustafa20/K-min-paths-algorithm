# K-min-paths-algorithm
A modification of BFS algorithm to find the k-min paths in a search tree by utilizing multiple parallelization strategies
# Parllelization Requirement
You should create a master/slave architecture either virtually or physically to execute the code in minimum time.
# Execution Division
The code executes by creating and executing 5 simultaneous processes that are mapped onto the master/slave architecture.
